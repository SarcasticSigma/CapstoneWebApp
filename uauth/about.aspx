        <h3>Why did we build SQUIRE?</h3>
        <p>As students at Middle Georgia State University, we were dissatisfied with the options for having packages delivered to the dorms on campus. This annoyance was the impetus for the inception of Squire. Squire is a storage system usable by Middle Georgia State University, (just the Macon campus for now), students in which they can have their packages registed to be delivered to the system for safekeeping. This system ensure that the packages always have somewhere to go and with our use of password protected, MGA ID bound lockers, your packages have never been safer.</p>
